* I love Docker!
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
My love for Docker eclipses my love for Vim

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
Just like Vim has made me rethink how I use my keyboard...

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
Docker has made me rethink how I run programs!

* Docker is like Sudoku
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear

* What we will be going over
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear appear appear appear appear)
- What is containerization
- What is Docker
- Implications
- Container orchestration

* Problem:
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
There are several problems with running computer programs that you may or may not have encountered

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear appear appear)
- Ensuring consistency of software environments (enforcing standards)
- Isolating program execution
- Trust

* What is containerization?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
What is a program?

** Containerization can be related to a regular program
You have a binary file and can run the binary file

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear appear)
- Image: the binary file
- Container: the running program

** I only know C++! How do I make images?
Let's start with Hello World

*** Hello World C++
Let's start with Hello World in C++...

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello world!" << std::endl;
}
#+END_SRC

*** How does that map to Docker?
#+BEGIN_SRC dockerfile
FROM ubuntu

CMD echo "Hello world!"
#+END_SRC

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
...what?

*** FROM
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"The FROM instruction initializes a new build stage and sets the Base Image for subsequent instructions"
#+END_QUOTE

*** CMD
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"The main purpose of a CMD is to provide defaults for an executing container"
#+END_QUOTE
*** Full Dockerfile reference:
[[https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/]]

** Containers are like Virtual Machines
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
We just skip loading the kernel and replace the init program!

*** But virtual machines are really secure!
Each virtual machine gets its own:
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear appear appear appear)
- Network configuration
- File system
- Running programs
- Hostname

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
Can we emulate anything like that for other programs?
Something more... performant?

*** Yes!
** Stepping back for a moment...
How is it that Linux computers /work/? How do they boot?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
Condensed version: a bootloader runs the kernel, and the kernel runs a program, the init program

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
What is the init program?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
What happens if you replace this init process with something else, something trivial like ~echo Hello World!~?

** Enter Containers and Namespaces
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
What kind of containing can we do with the Linux kernel?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
The Linux kernel has the following namespaces:

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear appear appear appear appear appear appear appear)
- Mount (file systems)
- Process ID (running programs)
- Network
- Interprocess Communication (IPC)
- UTS (hostname)
- User ID
- Control group
- Time

** Containers are ephemeral
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
/No changes you make are saved/

** Do we need Docker in order to manage containers?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
Actually, no!

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
For GUI applications: Snapcraft and Flatpak

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
For CLI applications/services: containerd.io, podman, Fedora toolbox

** In essence
A container is a program running in namespaces that are defined as smaller than the host system, and runs in an execution environment as defined by the base image and runtime parameters

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
Where does Docker fit in?
* What is Docker?
Relative to containerization, Docker is simple

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
Docker is a service/daemon for configuring and running containerized applications as well as the interface to said daemon

** What do services need that Docker provides for us?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear appear appear appear appear)
- Build
- Image
- Container
- Network
- Volumes

*** We've seen building, images, and containers... what about networks?
We can create a network with ~docker network create [NAME]~ and attach it to containers made with ~docker run~ using ~--network~

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
After creating the network, we can make containers which can connect to the network and make themselves available to other containers in that network, and /only/ other containers in that network.

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
Quick aside: make sure your Docker container exposes only to the network you want it to!

*** And volumes?
Volumes are where things get interesting, as they provide a way for containers to interact with filesystems outside their own

They are mounted by using ~-v [volume-name]:[mount-point]~ with ~docker run~

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
There are two primary volume types to worry about: Docker volumes, and bind mounts

*** First, Docker volumes
A special data structure which can be managed by the Docker daemon for you, and their paths look like the volume name

*** More importantly: bind mounts
What if we could just take a folder on our host systems and make it available inside the docker container?

*** Docker daemon
On top of allowing services to run, Docker also provides multiple management interfaces to manage containers

* "This is cool and all... but what does it mean for me?"
Docker can be very simple. But its usage and implications can become very complex, very fast

** You can define safe, quarantined execution environments
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
'Nuff said
** You can define any Linux environment
** You can specify the user you run container as
** Security implications
Do you remember where we specified the user in the earlier commands?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
We didn't! It defaults to ~root~!

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
If someone has access to the Docker daemon, they can create containers with the root user if they so desire!

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
Essentially, if someone tells you, "I have access to the Docker daemon, but I'm not root", they are lying or don't understand Docker
** For Linux systems: you can provide access to host sockets
What kind of sockets are there?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear appear appear appear)
- Docker (~/var/run/docker.sock~)
- X11 (~/tmp/.X11-unix~)
- SSH (~/tmp/ssh-xxxxxxxxxxxx/agent.xxxx~)
- PulseAudio/PipeWire/ALSA etc.
** Security vulnerabilities
Have you heard of ~chroot~?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
If a Docker container isn't configured properly, using chroot you can gain access to your host

** Alternatively, bad socket use...
[[file:examples/06-docker-socket]]
* Container orchestration
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear appear)
- Docker compose
- Kubernetes

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
Why? Because running Docker commands ourselves is too difficult and boring

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
It's a jump from "virtual machines" to "networks of virtual machines"

** Docker compose
Docker compose allows defining a ~docker-compose.yml~ service file

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  mysql:
    image: mysql
    expose:
      - '3306'

  webapi:
    image: your_company_webapi
    environment:
      - DB_HOST=mysql
#+END_SRC

*** Where's the security?
What's the difference between these two configurations:

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  mysql_1:
    image: mysql
    expose:
      - '3306'

  mysql_2:
    image: mysql
    ports:
      - '3306:3306'
#+END_SRC

*** What's the difference between ~expose~ and ~ports~?
[[file:images/docker-compose-network-2.png]]

** Kubernetes
Kubernetes (k8s) is a program where you tell the Kubernetes API server: "create containers in this configuration"

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  namespace: unitplannerv7
  name: mysql
  labels:
    name: mysql
spec:
  containers:
  - image: mysql:8.0.26
    name: mysql
    env:
    - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: mysql-password
          key: password
    ports:
    - containerPort: 3306
      name: mysql
    volumeMounts:
    - name: mysql-persistent-storage
      mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
  volumes:
  - name: mysql-persistent-storage
    hostPath:
      path: "/var/lib/mysql"
#+END_SRC

*** Another problem!
Remember when we mentioned that if someone has access to the Docker daemon, they can create containers as any user, to include root?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
This may sound incredibly obvious, but...

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
Kubernetes has access to the Docker daemon!

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
By proxy, if someone has access to the Kubernetes API server, they have access to the Docker daemon
** You keep saying improperly configured container orchestration is dangerous... prove it
* My challenge for you:
Create a MySQL database with the root password "toor" and exposed on port 3306

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag appear
Winner is defined as the first person that I can connect to using MySQL and run ~SELECT 1+1;~
